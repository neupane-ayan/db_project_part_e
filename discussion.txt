>>Modifications:
We changed a few of our queries because they were a little too ambitious. They dealt with a lot of time based 
comparisons and were ambiguous. Ex: "How much does a city’s population grow by in the 5 years following 3 or more
championships?” This were unnecessarily complex and we found queries that answered questions of similar topics
that were sufficiently complex as well.

>>Process:
No updates.

>>Successes:
Getting the data into one place was definitely a huge challenge. The data for the four sports are
scattered throughout sports reference. For each CSV, there was at least two different python scripts:
one to clean the data and one to put the 4 (basketball, football, hockey and baseball) together.

Some queries dealt with information from many different tables, so writing them was a tricky process.
Numerous trial and error, and some sub-queries were nested up to 4 times just to get the data we
needed.

>>Known Issues:

>>Extensions:
A huge problem we encountered early on was very spotty data from before 2000, in both Metro Area
information and sports information. We suspect that the lack of internet and technology had
something to do with this dearth of info. A great extension would be to apply this info
to the many years preceding 2000/2001, though I imagine that finding and verifying such data
would be a nightmare.

Another extension that would be cool is to see sports teams that changed cities. To see how
the economics of a city affects how many sports franchises it can support. A noticeable move
would be the Baltimore Bullets moving to DC when the economic state of Baltimore declined.
