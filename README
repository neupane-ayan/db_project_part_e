Nothing has been changed from previous parts.

Wanted to let you guys (the graders) know that not all of our
queries were compatible with CanvasJS because it only returned
one result, so there was really nothing to chart/graph.
A good number of our queries use canvasJS, and we also have
much more than 10 queries, so I think we used canvasJS sufficiently.

Furthermore, our insertion and deletion queries are marked with
INSERTION and DELETION respectively.

There are also informational queries, marked by INFORMATIONAL
for you guys to get accurate names for the MetroAreas and team
names because it gets confusing.

Also, the database is good enough where you can use the full
database (i.e: not the small). All the queries return instantly.
